## FAQ

### Does it aim to replace the original `JSplacement` software?

No. The application doesn't aim to replace `JSplacement`, but rather to provide a web-based alternative for those who don't want to find its downloads online and install it. Features-wise, it implements some from `JSplacement`, but also has some that didn't exist in it before (e.g., "Composition modes" or "Custom gradient generator").

### What happened to the original `JSplacement` software?

Unfortunately, the original `JSplacement` software is no longer maintained and it's gone. The author has abandoned the project and removed all the downloads from the internet.

Some links:

- Reddit post: [What happened to JSplacement](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/zfwmjr/does_anyone_know_what_happened_to_jsplacement/).
- Web port of `JSplacement`: [JSPlacementWeb](https://github.com/satelllte/JSPlacementWeb) _(missing some features)_.
- Consider supporting `Windmill` - the author of `JSPlacement`: [Website](https://windmillart.net/), [PayPal/WMillArt](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/WMillArt), [Ko-fi/windmill](https://ko-fi.com/windmill).

### Any future plans for `Displacement X`?

No particular plans. I've opened the source code of this project to everyone, so let's see how it goes.
